# TS-ANNO: An Annotation Tool to Build, Annotate and Evaluate Text Simplification Corpora

We introduce TS-ANNO, an open-source web application for manual creation and for evaluation of parallel corpora for text simplification (TS). 
TS-ANNO can be used for (i) sentenceâ€“wise alignment, (ii) rating alignment pairs (e.g., wrt. grammaticality, meaning preservation, ...), 
(iii) annotating alignment pairs wrt. simplification transformations (e.g., lexical substitution, sentence splitting, ...), and (iv) manual simplification of complex documents. 
For evaluation, TS-ANNO calculates inter-annotator agreement of alignments (i) and annotations (ii).

## Demo 
You can test annotation tool in our [live demo](https://ts-anno.phil.hhu.de/) (user: *test*, password: *TS_anno22*) or watch our demonstration video on YouTube.

## Installation

- install python3
  - if you want to use the support of the automatic simplification system MUSS, we recommend to use Python < 3.8, as MUSS is dependent on fairseq, which is yet not compatible with Python 3.9
- install packages, if you use conda install uwsgi with  `conda install -c conda-forge uwsgi` 
- install postgres
- set up postgres db with `sudo -u postgres psql`
  - `postgres=# create database demo_ts_anno with owner postgres;
  `
  - `postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';`
  - set settings.py (or secret_files/xxx.json) with database name (_demo_ts_anno_), user name (_postgres_), and password (_postgres_) 
  - fill database with demo database `psql demo_ts_anno < demo_ts_anno.sql` OR
  - start with empty database
    - `python manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python manage.py migrate`
    - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` 
- `python manage.py runserver` open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser
- register another user, e.g., _test_, in the interface

## Main Functionalities
### Upload Data
TS-Anno supports different methods and settings of data upload.
- A web crawler which upload and pre-process parallel online documents to align and annotate.
- Local data upload:
  - of aligend texts (e.g., previously aligned or generated by a TS sytem) which can be annotated or rated in TS-ANNO.
  - of non-aligned data to manually simplify these texts.
For further settings see [.demo/Upload_Data.md](./demo/Upload_Data.md).

### Manual Sentence Alignment
One main functionality is manual sentence-wise alignment. The uploaded texts are split into sentences by SpaCy, so that several sentences of the complex and simple document can be aligned with each other. TS-ANNO supports n:m alignemnts, e.g., produced by a sentence split or merge of sentences. With the wand button most similar simple sentences of the current complex sentence can be shown.

### Manual Rating 
TS-ANNO supports manual rating of aligned sentence pairs. In the video below the default evaluation aspects are shown, the aspects as well as the scale size can be changed at [./settings_annotation/config_rating.py](./settings_annotation/config_rating.py).

### Manual Annotation of Rewriting Transformations
Another functionality of TS-ANNO is the annotation of rewriting transformations performed during the simplification. One can mark the affected tokens of the rewriting in one or both of the texts and choose the level of the transformation and if identifiable also the class and sub transformation. This process can be repeated for all transformations of the pair. The name of the classes and transformations can be changed at [./settings_annotation/config_transformation.py](./settings_annotation/config_transformation.py).

### Simplification
Another kind of annotation supported by TS-anno is the manual simplification. The annotator can choose as many sentences as they want to simplify at once. The systems provides the annotator with some simplification guidelines and an suggestion generated by an text simplification system.
